# Odin Recipes
A simple HTML project built as part of <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com">The Odin Project</a> curriculum. I'm using this project to (re)learn web development fundamentals the right wayâ€”with a strong focus on clean code and accessibility best practices.

## Built With
<ul>
    <li>HTML</li>
</ul>

## Accessibility Features
<ul>
    <li>Semantic HTML structure</li>
    <li>Descriptive alt attributes on images</li>
    <li>Logical heading hierarchy</li>
</ul>

## What I Learned
This project was a refresher. No new concepts, just getting back into the rhythm of writing clean HTML and keeping accessibility in mind from the start.
