    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 package sliced bacon diced</li>
            <li>5 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
            <li>1/4 cup all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>4 cups milk or more if needed</li>
            <li>6 russet potatoes peeled and cubed</li>
            <li>3 green onions sliced thin</li>
            <li>1 1/2 cup shredded cheddar cheese + more for garnish</li>
            <li>1/2 cup sour cream</li>
            <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
        </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Peel and cube the potatoes and keep submerged in a bowl of water to avoid discoloration of the potatoes until you need them.</li>
            <li>Cook the diced bacon in a big skillet on medium heat until brown and crispy. Transfer to a paper towel lined plate to cool.</li>
            <li>In a large stockpot melt the butter over medium heat. Whisk in the flour until lightly browned for about one minute. Gradually whisk in the milk, and cook, continue whisking until slightly thickened, about 1-2 minutes. Stir in the potatoes and about half of the sliced green onions.</li>
            <li>Bring the soup to a boil for a short time. Reduce the heat and simmer until the potatoes are tender, about 15-20 minutes. Stir in the cheese, sour cream, salt and pepper, to taste. If the soup is too thick, you can always add more milk if needed until you reach a desired consistency.</li>
            <li>Serve warm and garnish with a dollop of sour cream, salt and pepper, a sprinkle of sliced green onion, crispy bacon bits, and grated cheddar cheese.</li>
        </ol>
